A place where I can express my ideas of politics, religion, and programming. Things that are close to me in this chapter of my life.

### Spirit Properties

Spirit propeprties are the nature of the world around us. I want to create quick cheatsheets of properties common thing around us contain. therefore when we search for something like love as an intention, we find:

* Animals that represent love
* Spices
* Crystals
* Colors
* Fruit
* Vegetables

That all represent love. That way ENW can be a tool used during times of planning.

#### Quests

Quests give you tasks that can accomplish an intention. If your intention is love, perhaps your quest is to meet someone new, or setup that tinder account.

##### Exercises

Along with quests are exercises. Perhaps there's workouts and yoga's you could also incorperate.

Allow yourself to fully submerge into your intention.
